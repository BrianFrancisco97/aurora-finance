# 🏢 Aurora Finance

Enterprise-style Financial Management Dashboard designed for revenue tracking, expense control and performance visualization.

Aurora Finance centralizes financial data into a clean and intuitive interface — providing structured dashboards, reporting tools and export workflows in a lightweight, self-contained environment.

## 🚀 Overview

Aurora Finance was built to simulate a real-world financial SaaS environment and demonstrate modern front-end engineering practices.

The system addresses common small-business needs:

* Lack of financial visibility

The platform provides structured dashboards, transaction management and export-ready reporting.
